# Pixil LED Matrix Control

A Python-based scripting language for controlling 64x64 LED matrix displays with Raspberry Pi.

## Overview

Pixil is a hobby project that makes it easy to create animations and visualizations on RGB LED matrix displays using a Raspberry Pi. The project includes a custom scripting language that abstracts away the complexities of controlling LED matrices directly.

## Project Structure

- **Pixil.py**: Main script interpreter - Parses and executes Pixil script commands
- **pixil_utils/**: Utility functions for parsing, math operations, and script management
- **rgb_matrix_lib/**: LED matrix interface and drawing operations
- **shared/**: Queue system for command execution
- **scripts/**: Example Pixil scripts demonstrating various animations

## Features

- Custom scripting language designed specifically for LED matrix control
- Support for drawing shapes, text, sprites, and animations
- Frame control for complex animations
- Variable system for dynamic content
- Control structures (if/then/else, loops)
- Math functions and expressions
- Array support for data management
- Sprite operations for efficient animations
- Text rendering with multiple effects
- Color control with named colors and intensity

## Installation

[Installation instructions coming soon]

## Example Scripts

The project includes over 70 example scripts demonstrating various animations and effects:
- 3D Perspective
- Aurora Borealis
- Bouncing Ball
- Digital Rain
- Fireworks
- And many more!
