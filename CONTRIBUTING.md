## Getting Started

To get started with development:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pixil-led-matrix.git`
3. Set up the development environment (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md))
4. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report and reproduce the issue.

- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Provide specific examples
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs if possible
- Include details about your configuration and environment:
  - Which version of Pixil you're using
  - Raspberry Pi model and OS version
  - LED matrix type and configuration

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before Submitting an Enhancement Suggestion**

- Check that your suggestion hasn't already been proposed
- Check if the feature exists in a recent version

**How to Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion**

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Provide specific examples to illustrate the steps
- Describe the current behavior and explain the behavior you'd like to see
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Pixil users

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Pixil? You can start by looking at these categories:

- **Beginner issues** - issues that should only require a few lines of code
- **Documentation** - improvements to README, INSTALL, or code comments
- **Example scripts** - new demonstration scripts or improvements to existing ones
- **Bug fixes** - addressing reported issues

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Include tests when adding new features
- The PR should work against the master branch

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving code structure/format
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üö± `:non-potable_water:` when fixing memory leaks
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files

### Python Styleguide

All Python code should adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Additionally:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length of 100 characters

### Pixil Script Styleguide

For Pixil scripts:

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Use clear, descriptive variable names with v_ prefix
- Group related commands together
- Use comments to explain complex sections
- For complex scripts, use procedures to organize code
- Follow this order for script sections:
  1. Constants and initial variable declarations
  2. Array creation and initialization
  3. Procedure definitions
  4. Main script logic

Example:
```
# Constants and initial variables
v_radius = 5
v_color = "blue"
v_speed = 2

# Array creation
create_array(v_positions, 10)
for v_i in (0, 9, 1) then
    v_positions[v_i] = v_i * 7
endfor v_i

# Procedure definition
def draw_pattern {
    for v_i in (0, 9, 1) then
        draw_circle(v_positions[v_i], 32, v_radius, v_color, 100, true)
    endfor v_i
}

# Main script logic
while v_running == true then
    call draw_pattern
    rest(0.5)
endwhile
```

## Project Structure

Understanding the project's structure will help you contribute effectively:

- **Pixil.py**: Main script interpreter
- **pixil_utils/**: Utility functions for parsing, math operations, and script management
  - Focus on this directory for language feature changes
- **rgb_matrix_lib/**: LED matrix interface and drawing operations
  - Focus on this directory for hardware interaction changes
- **shared/**: Queue system for command execution
  - Focus on this directory for performance improvements
- **scripts/**: Example Pixil scripts
  - Add new examples here

When adding new features, consider which component of the system should be modified.
